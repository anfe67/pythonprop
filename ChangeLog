Uses the codecs package to open files to read unicode directly.  This permits
the use of non-ascii characters in site names.  Modifies the way in which we
look for the FREQ card in output files to a more robust (and simpler) method
that doens't require regex..

Revised the order of some of the imports to remove the 'AttributeError: When
using gi.repository you must not import static modules like "gobject". Please
change all occurrences of "import gobject" to "from gi.repository import
GObject". See: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70918' warning
message on new versions fo GTK3(3.14).  This has the effect of changing the
backend to TkAgg.

Included a .desktop file for voacapgui that allows the application to be called up directly on the Gnome desktop.  This should also work on Unity but has not been tested.
Extensively modified the directory structure and build files which now follow a more conventional automake methodology, hopefully making future work much easier to manage.  One side effect of this is that the applications now installs to different locations.  /usr/local/bin for the wrapper scripts used to start the applications from the command line, /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ for the python files and /usr/local/share/pythonprop/ for the UI files and support data files.
