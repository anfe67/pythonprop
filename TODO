- Internationalisation/localization (ES addded by FM)
- Add a source file editor to let experienced users
examine/tweak the source
- Add the ability to create movie/slideshows of the area plots.
- Add some informative messages to the status bar. These can be coupled to the
  input data valiadtion routines and advise a user why a run cannot be
  performed, e.g. 'No SSNs specified' etc.
- Add a left-right button pair to the plot output screens to navigate through
  plots without bouncing back to the popup.

Bugfixes
- The 'greyline' feature doesn't work on any plot types other than the 
regular cartesian.  Fix this or switch off greylining when other 
projections are specified.
- Plotting direct to files doesn't look very neat, this needs to be sorted
out.
- The site chooser dialog box reverts back to the original size when opened.
- Review the way that the plot put windows are opened from the plot configuration GUI.  (A possible design model is the gnome 'about' dialog which pops up a second dialog when the credits button is pressed.)
